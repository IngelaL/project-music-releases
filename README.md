# Music Releases üé∂

This week's project was to build a  Music Releases site, the first project we build in React. We have done the project in pair programming.
We were given a Spotify API to new albums and singles releases and we used React components and props to build a page which show the album cover images, album names and artist names. We also added links to the albums' and artists' Spotify URLs.
In the css we used flexbox to make the albums show in a column or in rows depending on device. And we used media queries to make the site responsive. Moreover, we have added some details with icons showing on hovering. The styling was made by imitating a provided design (kind of Spotify style).

# Planning & The problem üß©

We started by looking into JSX and planning the components and how we should structure the project since this was our first time using React ‚ö°Ô∏è! We created a "Album List" component that would contain all of the other components, like for example, the album cover image, album & artists names. The album list and the data in the components was generated by iterating over the Spotify API data that we were provided with.

JSX and CSS styling was really important in this project and a bit of challenge since we were not used to it done in this manner, but in the end we were able to make the hover effects and style the page according to the project's design brief ‚ú®.

We ran into a bit of a problem to make the links work, but we fixed it in the end with research and team work üôå
